### **Fear not, i won’t judge you!**

### **– a way out of the pain of abortion**

**Abortion is an act against life**

Life is sacred. From the first moment to the last. Once it’s conceived, an embryo is a person. If they are allowed to live, to grow, to shape, they become individuals. Whether or not you know abortion is a sin, you will suffer spiritual and physical consequences. Shame, guilt, inner sadness arise whether the person is religious or not.

**What are the characteristic symptoms after abortion?**

Post abortion symptoms are similar to the symptoms of someone stuck in mourning. The most painful part is that the suffering person happens to be the one who caused the problem.

Symptoms can be various: anxiety, anger, self-accusation, low self-esteem, miscarriage, infertility, insomnia, addiction (drug or alcohol), and suicidal tendencies. After abortion, 70% of relationships end.

**The cure is the gracious love of Jesus**

You may refuse to listen to the sound of your heart for decades, but eventually something will renew the trauma you think you have forgotten: pregnancy, childbirth, miscarriage, menopause, mourning, divorce, illness or an accident. Then, pain will erupt with an elemental force. Anger, blame will rise in the woman towards everyone who talked her into it, who did not help her in her need. It hurts that no one said: „don’t do it!” They often blame God too: „If he really loves me, why did he let this happen to me?”

**Fruits of the weekends:**

Participants experienced that healing is possible, that they can start over even after such a shameful event which they did not even dare to talk about. Finding peace with God, with the people around you and within you can lead to a spiritual revival. This is partly the reason why people who are not religious can also attend.

**Testimonies from participants:**

* “After my abortion, I was unable to graduate from college. I gave up. I was treated with depression and I couldn’t stop blaming myself. Now, after the weekend, I applied to another school. I’m looking forward to it. I really hope that this time I won’t fail.”
* “I believed I wasn’t worthy to work in my profession – as a medical assistant. Today, I am a doctor, I help other people.”
* “At first I couldn’t tell my daughters they could have had other siblings. I was afraid they would despise me, judge me. I asked them to never make the same mistake. Should they ever be in trouble, I’ll be there. I can’t say they were proud of me, but our relationship became more honest.“
* “At the age of forty, I started attending Bible classes and had my First Communion. “
* “I found Mr. Right and we got married in a church. My frustration and the feeling that nothing matters both stopped. Our marriage is nothing like my past insecure relationships. We can lean on each other. It makes me feel safe. “
* “I have two teenage boys from two different relationships. My current partner and I’ve been together for 5 years, but no matter how hard we tried, we could not have a baby. I felt like the universe was punishing me for the babies I had given up when I was younger. After the weekend, at the age of 42, our daughter was conceived. We are so happy! “
